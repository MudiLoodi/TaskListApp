1. Delete the correct simulation widget from the simulation window when the simulation is complete. 
As of now, the simulation gets deleted correctly but its widget is not removed.

2. Create a new widget in the simulation window when creating a new instance. As of now, the new instance would only show up after re-opening the app.
